# Book Listing App.
### This project is implemented in Java.
### I used Loader Manager to do async tasks in a background thread (Tasks like downloading books images and getting books info json response).
### I used Connectivity Manager to check for internet connections and ListViews to show results also implemented an array adapter for using custom list views.
### Also Http connections were opened to send requests and recieve json responses.
